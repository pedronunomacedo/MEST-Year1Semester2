4. The data sets are in comma delimited format. The learning dataset
<dev.csv> contains 28623 records and 51 fields. The first/header
row of the data set contains the field names.

The validation dataset <comp.csv> contains 28910 records and 479
variables. The first/header row of the data set contains the field
names.

THE RECORDS IN THE VALIDATION DATASET ARE IDENTICAL TO THE RECORDS IN
THE LEARNING DATASET EXCEPT THAT THE VALUES FOR THE TARGET/DEPENDENT
VARIABLE IS MISSING.

5. The data dictionary (for both the learning and the validation data
set) is included in the file <dic.txt>. The fields in the data
dictionary are ordered by the position of the fields in the learning
data set. The dictionary for the validation data set is identical to
the dictionary for the learning data set except the target field
(target_B) are missing in the validation data set.

6. Blanks in the string (or character) variables/fields and periods in
the numeric variables correspond to missing values.

7. Each record has a unique record identifier or index (field name:
CONTROLN.) For each record, there are two target/dependent variable
(TARGET_B). TARGET_B is a binary variable
indicating whether or not the record responded to the promotion of
interest ("97NK" mailing).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
-------------------------

Participants will demonstrate the performance of their
tool by analyzing the results of one of PVA's recent fund raising
appeals.  This mailing was sent to a total of 3.5 million donors
who were on the database as of June 1997.  Everyone included in
this mailing had made at least one prior donation to PVA.

One group that is of particular interest to is "Lapsed" donors.
These are individuals who made their last donation to 13 to 24
months ago.  They represent an important group to PVA, since the
longer someone goes without donating, the less likely they will be to
give again.  Therefore, recapture of these former donors is a critical
aspect of PVA's fund raising efforts.

However, has found that there is often an inverse correlation
between likelihood to respond and the dollar amount of the gift, so a
straight response model (a classification or discrimination task) will
most likely net only very low dollar donors.  High dollar donors will
fall into the lower deciles, which would most likely be suppressed
from future mailings.  The lost revenue of these suppressed donors
would then offset any gains due to the increased response rate of the
low dollar donors.

Therefore, to improve the cost-effectiveness of future direct
marketing efforts, wishes to develop a model that will help them
maximize the net revenue (a regression or estimation task) generated
from future renewal mailings to Lapsed donors.

POPULATION
----------

The population for this analysis will be Lapsed donors who
received the June '97 renewal mailing (appeal code "97NK").
Therefore, the analysis data set contains a subset of the total
universe who received the mailing.

The analysis file includes all Lapsed donors who received the
mailing, with responders to the mailing marked with a flag in the
TARGET_B field.

The overall response rate for this direct mail promotion is 5.1%.  

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DATA SOURCES and ORDER & TYPE OF THE VARIABLES IN THE DATA SETS    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

The dataset includes:

o 24 months of detailed promotion and giving history (covering the
  period 12 to 36 months prior to the "97NK" mailing)

o A summary of the promotions sent to the donors over the most recent
  12 months prior to the "97NK" mailing (by definition, none of these
  donors responded to any of these promotions)

o Summary variables reflecting each donor's lifetime giving history
  (e.g., total # of donations prior to "97NK" mailing, total $ amount
  of the donations, etc.)

o Overlay demographics, including a mix of household and area level
  data

o All other available data from the database (e.g., date of first
  gift, state, origin source, etc.)

The fields are described in greater detail in the data dictionary file
<filename: dic.txt>.

The name of the variables in the learning and validation data sets is
included in each file as the top (header) record.

General 
-------

o The field CONTROLN is a unique record identifier (an index) and
should not be used in modeling

o Response flag (field name: TARGET_B) indicates whether or not the
lapsed donor responded to the campaign. THIS FIELD SHOULD NOT BE USED
DURING MODEL BUILDING.

o Blanks in string or character variables correspond to missing
values.  Periods and/or blanks in the numeric variables correspond to
missing values.

Data preprocessing tasks include the following:

Time Frame and Date Fields
--------------------------

This mailing was mailed to a total of 3.5 million donors who were
on the database as of June 1997. All information contained in the
analysis dataset reflects the donor status prior to 6/97 (except the
gift receipt dates, which will follow the promotion dates.) This date
could be used as the "end date" or "rerefence date" in the calculation
of "number of months since" variables.
